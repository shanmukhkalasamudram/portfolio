  "about_me": "Hey there! I'm Shanmukhasai K V, a laid-back yet results-driven Software Engineer. Currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at SUNY Buffalo. I specialize in crafting scalable microservices and turbocharging REST APIs for high performance. Beyond coding, you'll often find me mentoring and guiding team members towards awesome, collaborative outcomes.\n\n Oh, and did I mention? I'm not just a backend maestro; I've got the React magic up my sleeves, too, building sleek front-end experiences.\n\n When I'm not deep in code, I'm diving into the realms of Stock Exchanges, keeping an eye on current politics, and pondering over social issues. Let's build something cool together!",
